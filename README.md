# (github told me to make a readme)

[This is my website, apparently.](redstonulo.github.io) It is very work in progress.

When I'm done with the project (which will probably never happen), every documentation that exists of my languages, scripts and other worldbuilding stuff will be on there.

Every page will be multilingual. So far I have the following languages planned:

 - English
 - German
 - French
 - Esperanto
 - Spanish
 - Finnish (?)
 - Korean (?)
 - Japanese (?)
 - Hwêledu
 - Csiakalász
 - Nyászokeányi
 - Kymýš
 - Thīrachti

Also, there is going to be all sorts of tools like a text-to-IPA converter ("Hwêledu" -> ['ʰweˑlɛðy]).

Maybe I'm even going to host some games there, like this idea of 16x16 chess I once had in the middle of the night. Who knows.
